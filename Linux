Chmod
sudo chmod  o+w /var/www/html

#restart service apache2
sudo service apache2 restart

Update: the following seems to have worked:

Establish a [new directory] at /var/www
Change the directory owner and group:
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/[new directory]
allow the group to write to the directory with appropriate permissions:
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www
Add myself to the www-data group:
sudo usermod -a -G www-data [my username]
Logout and login again.

Thanks.
